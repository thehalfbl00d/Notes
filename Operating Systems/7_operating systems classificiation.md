- very unreliable, one thing breaks, everything breaks
- does not enforce data hiding
- good performance

## Microkernel became Layered Architectureel became Layered Architecture

- MS-DOS did not take it in.

# Layered Architecture - became Modular Loadable - Dynamic kernel, don't need to reboot

Dynamic kernel, Dont need to reboot

### BASH is **bourne shell**


# Android 
#learn cocoa for android development 
#learn java for android, the other languages transpile into java.
