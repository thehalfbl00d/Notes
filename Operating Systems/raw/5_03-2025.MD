# Preemptive
Preemptive scheduling allows a process to be stopped and reallocated the resources to another service.

# Non-Preemptive
    
    cant be stopped and reallocated the resources to another service

# Dispatcher
  it gives control of the cpu to the process selected by the cpu scheduler
  CRITERIAS:   
    1. cpu utilization | maximise
    2. throughput - number of process completed per unit time | maximise
    3. turnaround time - sum of time spent waiting {Completion Time - Arrival Time} | minimise
    4. waiting time | minimise
    5. response time | minimise

## burst time
    time taken by cpu to complete the process

## convoy effect: short process behind longer process



# scheduling methonds

## 1. first come first server

## 2. shortest job first (SJF) scheduling
can do premptive and non premptive methods, premptive continuosly looking for lesser burst time, even if it is doing something.

limitations:
    1. used when all processes have equal priority
    2. (for all) guestimate (look at history), well doesnt know what is the bubble burst of next process
