<ul>
<li style="font-size: 14px;">
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">The OS1 2025 CA2 is a closed-book individual-based in-lab Brightspace Quiz Assessment. It will consist of a mixture of multiple choice questions, fill-in-the-blank questions, short questions, calculation questions and matching questions.&nbsp; There will be no negative marking.&nbsp; </span></p>
</li>
<li style="font-size: 14px;">
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">For the duration of the CA2, students are only permitted to access Brightspace (to sit the CA2 only, not to reference lecture/lab materials) and access the Windows Command Line Console. &nbsp;Access to all other resources (physical or digital) are prohibited (students are not allowed to access previously created documents or files either in physical form or in their Windows Console or any where else).</span></p>
</li>
<li style="font-size: 14px;">
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">When and where: <strong>The CA2 takes place on Wednesday 9th April 2025 during your normal scheduled lab session</strong>.&nbsp; There is only one sitting of the CA2 and this is it!&nbsp; Attendance is mandatory.&nbsp; There will be no resit opportunities.&nbsp; </span></p>
</li>
<li style="font-size: 14px;">
