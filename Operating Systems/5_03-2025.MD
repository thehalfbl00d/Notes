# Preemptive
Preemptive scheduling allows a process to be stopped and reallocated the resources to another service.

# Non-Preemptive
Non-preemptive scheduling does not allow a process to be stopped and reallocated the resources to another service.

# Dispatcher
The dispatcher gives control of the CPU to the process selected by the CPU scheduler.

## Criteria
1. **CPU Utilization**: Maximize
2. **Throughput**: Maximize the number of processes completed per unit time
3. **Turnaround Time**: Minimize the sum of time spent waiting (Completion Time - Arrival Time)
4. **Waiting Time**: Minimize
5. **Response Time**: Minimize

## Burst Time
The time taken by the CPU to complete the process.

## Convoy Effect
Occurs when a short process is stuck behind a longer process.

# Scheduling Methods

## 1. First Come First Serve (FCFS)

## 2. Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling
### Limitations:
1. Used when all processes have equal priority.
2. Requires estimation (based on history), does not know the burst time of the next process.
