## String Literals

String literals are **read-only**, meaning they cannot be directly modified. When you assign a string literal to a `char *`, you're essentially pointing to a read-only memory location. Attempting to modify it can lead to **undefined behavior**, including crashes. They cannot be passed by reference for modification.
```
e.g., char *str = "hello";
```

## Note

1. ``` in name[10] = "mark"; ```

- it just prints mark, will not do any replacing part then will just 

2. char name1[6] = "sheron"; // this is a not a null terminated.



## copying one string to another 

### strcpy(destination string, source string)
- if source size > destination size we will have buffer overflow

\0 is the null terminator, this ends the string, it marks the end of string.



#### gets is dangerous as it keeps reading characters , doesnt care about buffer overflow

#### use of scanf breaks when the user enters an escape character

## Additional Clarifications
- It's good practice to use safer functions (e.g., `fgets`) instead of `gets`.
- Always include a null terminator in character arrays to avoid undefined behavior.

### Stack Smashing
- "Stack smashing detected" occurs when a buffer overflow corrupts the stack.
