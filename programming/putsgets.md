so we have gets and puts, 
the gets function is dangerous, it's not memory safe.

this was deprecated, is replaces with fgets. fgets dont read files

scanf, any normal input funciton stops reading the input once it hits a whitespace chanracter like space.
gets, will read whitespace characters also stuff after it
fgets, will also read after whitespace charater
