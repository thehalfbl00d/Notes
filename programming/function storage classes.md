## Functions and Storage Classes Notes

Here are some notes on Functions and Storage Classes:

### Functions

*   **Definition:** A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Built-in Functions:**  Predefined functions (e.g., `printf`, `scanf`).
    *   **User-defined Functions:** Functions created by the programmer.
*   **Storage Classes:**
    *   **auto:** (Default) Local to the block in which they are defined.
    *   **static:**  Retains its value between multiple calls to the function.
    *   **extern:**  Variable is defined in another file.
    *   **register:** Suggests to the compiler to store the variable in a register.
