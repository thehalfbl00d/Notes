string literals are read only, that it cant be passed by reference
```
e.g., char *str = "hello";
```

## Note

1. ``` in name[10] = "mark"; ```

- it just prints mark, will not do any replacing part then will just 

2. char name1[6] = "sheron"; // this is a not a null terminated.



## copying one string to another 

### strcpy(destination string, source string)
- if source size > destination size we will have buffer overflow

\0 is the null terminator, this ends the string, it marks the end of string.
