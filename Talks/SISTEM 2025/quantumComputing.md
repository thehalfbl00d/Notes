# Quantum Computing

#### Use Cases:
- Simulation
- Optimization
- Cybersecurity
- Innovation

#### Challenges
- Hardware : fragile qbits
- Skills : learning curve, only phd 
- Cost : fuckin expensive


#### Quantum Analogies

- Bloch sphere to depict qubit sphere
- a ice skater, standing on top of big ball, having a strip clocwise at top, will look like anti clockwise in the bottom of earth
