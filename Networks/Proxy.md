1. An Indian king was settling his kingdom, so established 5 islands
2. Then he gave out the address of his island to the main guy(DNS Manager) to send all traderes to those islands
3. But some traders were bad.
4. DNS actually cant see because of his blindfold.
5. so the king was smart, he knew his islands were well hidden and was anonymous, so he put a checkpost on the way and gave the main guy(the dns) the address to his checkpost insted of individual island.
6. Now every trader who comes through DNS goes through the checkpost(proxy) where they strip him off and do a thorough examination before giving him the actual address of the islands.

### What else does this proxy do?

#### Load Balancing
- if we get a shit ton of traders, the checkpost distributes them equally among the 5 islands.

#### Caching
- This checkpost also have a mini market for often traded goods. So they dont have to reveal the island address.

#### Translating (SSL Termination)
- If the trader turns out to be british(encrypted with SSL), his demands are first translated into Hindi and then they are satisfied, this saves the brainpower of the traders on the islands as they only speak Hindi(http) and can focus solely on trade.

#### Traffic Routing (URL Rewriting)
- if the trader wants swords, the checkpost will just give him the address of the island with the best swords.

#### Request Lodging
- The guard maintains a lodge book, lodging the names, request time and mood of the incoming traders.
