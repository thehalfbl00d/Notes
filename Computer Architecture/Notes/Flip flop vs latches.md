Both just stores 1 bit.

They are both way of storing data in a processor.

The Registers are cpu flip - flops.

Cache memory is latch based.

Flip-flops just stores data at just a precise moment.

Latches - Store data **as long as the control signal (enable) is ON**
### Latches (Simple Memory)
### Flip-Flops()
