## Digital Logic Representation

- electrical voltages are interpreted as binary values, this is called DLR.

This binary system is the foundation of all digital electronics. The smallest unit of data is a **bit**, which stores a single binary value. **Eight bits** grouped together form a **byte**. A byte can represent:

- Numbers from 0 to 255 in decimal (e.g., 11111111 = 255),
    
- A character in ASCII (e.g., 01000001 = ‘A’),
    
- Or parts of multimedia like colors in images or samples in audio.
    

Bytes are the basic building blocks of all data in a computer. Files, programs, and communication protocols are all structured in bytes, making them essential to digital system
