## Transistors

- they are switches controlled by Vdd and GND.
- The transistors in modern day circuits are called "Metal Oxide Semicondutor Field Effect Transitors". or just =  MOSFETS =  or  = FETs
- They have 3 terminals, which can conduct electricity between 2 when the third one sends the permission.(appropriate logic signal)

## FETs 

VDD = positive supply voltage.

So basically they are transistors, they have 3 legs.

When gate voltage â‰¥ threshold, electron gathers under the gate forming a conductive channel which turns nEFT fully on.

nFET = electron flow (negative carriers)
pFET = hole flow (positive carriers)

#### Rules:

- pFET sources must connect to vdd and nFE3
  








 sources must connect o GND.
